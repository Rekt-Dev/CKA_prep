ing Configmaps as environment variables
To use a Configmap in an environment variable in a Pod:

For each container in your Pod specification, add an environment variable for each Configmap key that you want to use to the env[].valueFrom.configMapKeyRef field.
Modify your image and/or command line so that the program looks for values in the specified environment variables.
This is an example of defining a ConfigMap as a pod environment variable:

The following ConfigMap (myconfigmap.yaml) stores two properties: username and access_level:

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: myconfigmap
data:
  username: k8s-admin
  access_level: "1"
