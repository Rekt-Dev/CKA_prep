heck access mode

PV local-pv: ReadWriteOnce ✅

PVC local-pvc: ReadWriteOnce ✅
Good, they match.

2. Check storage class

PV: local-path ✅

PVC: local-path ✅
Also matches.

3. Check capacity

PV: 500Mi

PVC requests: 500Mi ✅
Matches exactly.

4. Check volumeMode

PV defaults to Filesystem (unless set differently)

PVC requests Filesystem ✅
Good.

5. Check binding by claim reference

The PV status is Available. That means Kubernetes hasn’t auto-bound it yet. Why?

Because your PV might need the spec.claimRef filled automatically or dynamic provisioning enabled. Static PVs don’t always bind automatically to a PVC unless they are strictly compatible and the cluster allows it.

6. How to force binding

Add this to the PV spec:

spec:
  claimRef:
    namespace: default
    name: local-pvc


This tells Kubernetes:

“Bind this PV to this exact PVC.”

Without it, Kubernetes sees the PV as Available, the PVC as Pending, and doesn’t auto-bind.

TL;DR

PV exists ✅

PVC exists ✅

Auto-binding didn’t happen because this is a static PV

Solution: add claimRef to PV or recreate PV after PVC creation

After that, the PVC should go Bound



STORAGECLASS: !!!! Just on PV and PVC. The Pod only references the PVC—it doesn’t care about the storage class.

PV → storageClassName: local-path

PVC → storageClassName: local-path

Pod → volumes points to the PVC name, that’s it.
