 
 add

Adds a place where charts live. Like adding an apt repo.

helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update


→ “Helm, remember where charts are and refresh the list.”

2️⃣ helm search

Find a chart.

helm search repo nginx


→ “Show me charts with nginx in the name.”

3️⃣ helm install

Install an app into Kubernetes.

helm install my-nginx bitnami/nginx


→ “Install nginx and call it my-nginx.”

With values:

helm install my-nginx bitnami/nginx --set service.type=NodePort


→ “Same app, but tweak one setting.”

4️⃣ helm upgrade

Change an existing install.

helm upgrade my-nginx bitnami/nginx --set replicaCount=3


→ “Keep it installed, just change stuff.”

5️⃣ helm uninstall

Remove it.

helm uninstall my-nginx


→ “Delete everything Helm created.”

One concept you MUST know

Chart = app template

Release = your installed copy of that chart

helm list


→ “Show me what I installed.”

Mental model (important)

Helm =
kubectl apply

templates

sane defaults

one command instead of 20 YAMLs
