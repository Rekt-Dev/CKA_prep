KA purposes, you need to know the flow:

Upgrade kubeadm (you just did it).

Plan the cluster upgrade:

kubeadm upgrade plan


Upgrade the control plane node:

kubeadm upgrade apply v1.33.7


Upgrade kubelet and kubectl on each node (including control plane):

sudo apt-mark unhold kubelet kubectl
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y kubelet=1.33.7-1.1 kubectl=1.33.7-1.1
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubectl
sudo systemctl restart kubelet


Check cluster version:

kubectl get nodes
kubectl version


Everything above is literally from the official Kubernetes kubeadm upgrade guide:

Kubernetes: Upgrading kubeadm clusters
