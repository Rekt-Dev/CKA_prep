perators
Operator	Meaning
Equal	Must match key AND value (and effect if specified)
Exists	Tolerates any value of the key; effect still matters
2. Effects
Effect	Behavior
NoSchedule	Pod cannot schedule on node unless it tolerates the taint
PreferNoSchedule	Scheduler tries to avoid, but can still schedule
NoExecute	Pod evicted immediately if running; new pods cannot schedule unless tolerated
3. Examples

Taint on node:

kubectl taint nodes worker1 key1=value1:NoSchedule
kubectl taint nodes worker2 key2:NoExecute
kubectl taint nodes worker3 key3=value3:PreferNoSchedule


Matching tolerations in pod spec:

# Exact match (Equal)
tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value1"
  effect: "NoSchedule"

# Exists operator, ignores value
- key: "key2"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "NoExecute"

# PreferNoSchedule toleration
- key: "key3"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "PreferNoSchedule"

4. Quick tips for CKA labs

NoSchedule → must tolerate to schedule

PreferNoSchedule → scheduling is optional

NoExecute → affects existing pods too

Use Exists for generic tolerations; Equal for precise key/value matches

Always check node taints:

kubectl describe node <node-name> | grep -i taint -A3
