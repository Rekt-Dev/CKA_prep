One co-worker deployed an nginx helm chart kk-mock1 in the kk-ns namespace on the cluster. A new update is pushed to the helm chart, and the team wants you to update the helm repository to fetch the new changes.


After updating the helm chart, upgrade the helm chart version to 18.1.15.



Is the deployment running?

Is the chart version upgraded?
